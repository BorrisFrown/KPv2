    <string name="van_desc">After pastoring cessationist churches for 15 years, God
opened Van’s heart to the full ministry of the Holy Spirit in
1994. He and his wife, Laurie, eventually launched Vineyard
Northwest in 2001. In 2011–2012, they began to lead the
church into a renewed passion for the Holy Spirit, with a
focus on presence-driven worship, healing, and prophetic
ministry. Kingdom Pursuit is a product of this powerful Holy Spirit journey,
as well as the next step towards fulfilling the church’s call to be a church with
a Holy Spirit-empowered, regional impact.
In addition, Van grew up in East Brady, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh, and
yes, he is a die-hard Steelers fan, somehow surviving in Bengals’ territory. It helps
that Laurie is from Cincinnati. They have four children (40, 38, 36 and 29), all
married, and 9 grandchildren so far. Van loves guns and shooting as a hobby.
Laurie grew up on the east side of Cincinnati and loves playing tennis. They’ve
been married for close to 45 years and love each other more than ever. </string>

    <string name="clay_desc">Born into a military family that traveled the world, Clay
experienced an “out of the ordinary” childhood. With a Mother
who was on fire for the gospel, and a disciplined Father
who served in the Army—Clay was immersed in a Baptist
and Pentecostal upbringing while living in Germany, Texas,
Maryland, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Despite being
prophesied at an early age that Clay would preach the gospel, he turned to a
life of sin. However, through many fascinating encounters of God’s grace, Clay
answered the call, surrendered to Christ at the age of 30 and was led to serve
as an itinerant evangelist. Clay now works as the Evangelism Pastor for the
Vineyard Church in Urbana, Illinois, where he resides with his wife, Regina,
and their two sets of boy-girl twins.</string>
